&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/website-car.png&quot; alt=&quot;Website dreams of a car&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-toyota&quot;&gt;Lessons from Toyota&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota seemed to defy the laws of physics as it took over the world’s auto industry. They managed to make better cars, with less labor and more selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have Amazon, somehow able to sell us things at a low price, with free shipping and a huge selection, and with customer service that puts them at the top of all companies in the US. And then they repeat that success with cloud services, devices, entertainment, and AI. What makes these two companies so exceptional? It turns out that they have a lot in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-not-about-top-down-improvements&quot;&gt;It’s not about top-down improvements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What many businesses took away from Toyota was that they needed to be lean. They interpreted this as cutting costs, which they did - as a top-down process. Other businesses learned that they should use just-in-time inventory, which was easy to implement as a tightening up of their existing approach. Still others learned that they should be meticulous with data to eliminate defects, and Six Sigma &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=O6276jidG3IC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;was born&lt;/a&gt; - as a centralized, top-down process. Only a few adopted the plumbing that led to these efficiencies - empowered employees, working on small batches. Bottom-up feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;small-batches-were-the-key&quot;&gt;Small batches were the key&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Toyota made cars in small batches, they could fix errors quickly. This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Machine-That-Changed-World-Revolutionizing/dp/0743299795/&quot;&gt;their core innovation&lt;/a&gt;. To catch the errors, they needed empowered employees. The employees would find an error, come up with a fix, and the next small batch would be improved. It was all about operating at a small scale, within a big company. These small batches, and the culture of using the batches to continually learn and improve, led to the great results that others envied: the efficiency and small inventories called lean, and the low defects sought by Six Sigma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agile-software-follows-toyota&quot;&gt;Agile software follows Toyota&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was up to the tech startup world to fully embrace this plumbing, with agile development. The core of agile is to build software in small stages. This allows errors to be caught and fixed quickly, and a design can adapt to what’s been learned from the previous stage. Again, it’s about operating at a small scale. Instead of a small number of cars released at once, you have small amounts of programming code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amazons-twist&quot;&gt;Amazon’s twist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along came Amazon, inspired by the tech industry. Jeff Bezos started out in the 1990’s with a certain amount of agile development. And then, in the early 2000’s Bezos took inspiration from the core Toyota concept of small-scale processes, and the company went beyond agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a big traditional engineering organization putting out small batches of improvements, Bezos introduced the idea of the two-pizza team. This was a team small enough to be fed by two pizzas, and it was promoted as the main unit of organization in the company (though of course there were groupings above that, up to the VP level).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-two-pizza-rule-isnt-really-about-meetings&quot;&gt;The two-pizza rule isn’t really about meetings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for a two-pizza team is that people communicate well at that scale. You can all fit around a conference table together. But another even more important reason is that smaller teams own a smaller piece of the big product, and can iterate more quickly on improving it. Build, release, gather data on how well it worked, redesign, build, and repeat. This isn’t just meetings, it’s how you do your work every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-microservices&quot;&gt;The role of microservices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the chaos of having many small teams work on a big product? Wouldn’t they step on each others’ toes? This was addressed by breaking up big products - the platforms behind the retail website - into microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-blocks&quot;&gt;Building blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each microservice is a small chunk of a platform, designed to do one thing out of the many things the platform did. Each microservice provides an interface that allows other microservices to connect to it. They can then form a collection of services that replicates the old platform. Or, a microservice can be used to assemble a new system, like a building block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;many-separate-places-to-innovate&quot;&gt;Many separate places to innovate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really valuable thing about the microservice, though, is that it operates on a small scale. This makes it manageable by a small team, who are working in small batches. You now have a whole enterprise that is broken up into as many development cycles as possible, each one an opportunity to catch and fix errors. Or to find and fill opportunities for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: Toyota broke up its one big workflow, to get cars out the door. Amazon has gone further by also making many parallel workflows, each one broken up into batches like Toyota’s car production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amazing-results&quot;&gt;Amazing results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of having many small, fast development cycles is evident at Amazon. New products, like Amazon video, seem to appear almost overnight. Amazon Web Services (AWS) adds features at a blistering rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And contrary to some stereotypes, this isn’t all about engineers who work extra fast or stay extra late. It’s about catching and fixing errors as early as possible, and experimenting with innovations as frequently as possible. It’s about the plumbing of small batches, small teams, and small units of product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can this work for other companies? What cultural changes do you need to get there? We’ll toss around some ideas on those subjects in upcoming posts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lean" /><summary type="html">As Amazon roars across the global economy, we’re reminded of another company that roared in a similar manner back in the 1980s - Toyota.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Amazon and the environment</title><link href="/environment/2020/12/28/amazon-environment.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Amazon and the environment" /><published>2020-12-28T13:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-28T13:00:00-08:00</updated><id>/environment/2020/12/28/amazon-environment</id><content type="html" xml:base="/environment/2020/12/28/amazon-environment.html">&lt;p&gt;Could it be that Amazon is good for the environment? What about the cardboard boxes, and the trucks, and the power-hungry data centers? To understand what Amazon brings to the table, we need to look at the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/amazon-robot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon robot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, leave aside the observation that we all should consume less. This would be good for the environment, but it’s a different problem. Let’s just say that people are going to consume a certain amount per capita. We have two ways to make a smaller footprint on the planet while providing that stuff: fewer people, and greater efficiency.  Population seems to be taking care of itself, as people move to cities and have fewer children - a demographic transition. That leaves efficiency as the area where we can make real headway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;efficiency-is-good-for-the-environment&quot;&gt;Efficiency is good for the environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great thought experiment from the 1990s: what if our society increased efficiency by a factor of four? Then we could double our standard of living while cutting our resource use in half. This was proposed by Amory and Hunter Lovins and Ernst von Weizsacker, in their book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Factor-Four-Doubling-Halving-Resource-ebook/dp/B00ID6S61S/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=factor+four+lovins&amp;amp;qid=1578527501&amp;amp;sr=8-7&quot;&gt;Factor of Four&lt;/a&gt;. Their focus was on the consumer – things like more efficient energy usage in the home, recycling, efficient cars. And certainly these things are very important. However, the resources used by businesses - to make and distribute things - are greater than what we use as consumers. For example, energy used in homes is only about one quarter of the energy used in all buildings (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/&quot;&gt;US EIA report&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you make businesses more efficient? First, you cut waste, in the way that Toyota pioneered with their hyper-efficient car factories. This has been called lean manufacturing, and it’s based on an innovative way of organizing big companies, with intentionally small units. Amazon has extended this model of small teams and small batches of work to retail and online services and electronics. You might think that Toyota’s cost advantage comes from people working harder, or automation, but mainly it comes from a more efficient way of organizing people. James Womack and his coauthors describe this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Machine-That-Changed-World-Revolutionizing/dp/0743299795/&quot;&gt;The Machine That Changed the World&lt;/a&gt;, with their analysis of the global auto industry of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amazons-efficiency&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be said of Amazon’s efficiency - it’s in the way people are organized, not in how hard they work. It’s a more dynamic organization than most, with employees that are empowered to solve problems as they uncover them, and have the means to solve them because the teams are are so small and modular. This way of organizing people leads to savings and efficiencies in countless small ways, which add up to a more efficient system. The efficient system needs less fuel, less electricity, less real estate, and creates less pollution… than the alternative. Keep in mind that the alternative is a system of traditional warehouses and transportation, which Amazon out-competes because the traditional system is so wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tight-coordination&quot;&gt;Tight coordination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you use information systems to coordinate things. How does Amazon offer two-day delivery? By making smart use of information systems. Lots of computing power, and tight coordination. The part that the customer sees is fast delivery. Behind the scenes, all sorts of things are being tracked and optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Shared infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you provide shared infrastructure to businesses and consumers across the economy. The cloud computing offered by Amazon Web Services uses less energy than the scattered data centers once owned by individual businesses. There’s efficiency from scale, for example with cooling systems, and more opportunity to share hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, shoppers save countless trips to the store to buy things, if they have a delivery truck make the rounds instead. (This doesn’t improve the picture in Manhattan, where delivery trucks replace some very efficient foot traffic rather than SUVs, but it’s a benefit in most places.) The delivery truck consumes gas, but it saves many separate trips by gas-guzzling cars and in the end uses less gas. Less global warming, less air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;renewable-energy&quot;&gt;Renewable energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake is when Amazon commits to 100% &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/sustainable-operations&quot;&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;, and meeting the Paris Agreement 10 years early. You could say that the bigger contribution is still Amazon’s efficiency, because the rest of the economy is compelled to be more efficient in order to compete with Amazon. But it’s still a big deal when the shoppers’ SUVs are replaced with electric-powered delivery trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-real-impact-on-the-environment&quot;&gt;A real impact on the environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do I feel about working at Amazon, as a former environmental consultant and concerned citizen? I feel like I’m part of the solution. In fact, I feel like this is the best contribution I can possibly make to helping the environment, to work on root causes rather than just patching things up. After looking for ways to move the dial for many years, this is it - make the economy more efficient. Government regulations come and go, educating people is a slow process. If you want to make substantial change, you have to tie it to economic incentives and influence the way the whole economy operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another post we’ll look at a painful consequence of the more efficient economy - the loss of jobs. But let’s keep in mind that those jobs needed to go away, as part of the efficiency that will let us continue to live on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="environment" /><summary type="html">Could it be that Amazon is good for the environment?

But they ran into competition from an unexpected source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stack-overflow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stack Overflow wins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-discovery&quot;&gt;A discovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when data flowed from Google like lemonade from Rock Candy Mountain (before 2012), this large company was able to track the performance of it’s pages for specific terms that the pages were about. A team of us were also able to track the performance of competitors’ pages for the same terms. What we found was surprising: the top performer for the majority of terms was &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. The second most popular site was Wikipedia, and the company’s own pages usually didn’t rank on the first page of search results at all. This meant that when people searched for terms on Google that were related to the company’s pages, the top search results were dominated by Stack Overflow. This pattern held true across hundreds of search terms and tens of thousands of pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because the developer community on the web had created more links to Stack Overflow than to the company’s pages. This had to mean they liked Stack Overflow better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-was-this-surprising&quot;&gt;Why was this surprising?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow’s popularity for these topics was surprising because the company’s own pages were written by professional technical writers, and then professionally edited. Stack Overflow’s posts were written by volunteer developers using broken English. Many of the Stack Overflow posts were barely intelligible - just readable enough to convey their technical idea, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-made-stack-overflow-so-much-better&quot;&gt;What made Stack Overflow so much better?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow did a number of things right. At least, these are the things that set them apart, and in hindsight probably were worked very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minimalism-worked&quot;&gt;Minimalism worked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting feature of the Stack Overflow posts was that they were extremely short. In some cases, they were just a couple of sentences with a code snippet. Since each post was treated as a web page, this made Google searches very effective for finding relevant content. It also meant that visitors didn’t need to spend lots of time reading. In some cases, the pages created by the company had thousands of words - they might run to more than 10 pages if printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relevance-was-the-key&quot;&gt;Relevance was the key&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the minimalism of Stack Overflow got more quickly to the point than the wordy, polished style of the company’s site. Excess text didn’t get in the way of relevance - useful topics were covered accurately, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the usefulness of the pages also came from the way the question-and-answer approach structured the information around tasks and problems. This is usually what we want when we Google something - to solve a problem or task. We don’t want to know about all of the features of some product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the relevance of the questions and answers was made clear by the voting system, a kind of gamification. More than a way to rate individual answers, this was also a way to build trust in the site and tap into the energy of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;community-effort-made-it-happen&quot;&gt;Community effort made it happen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly more important than the details of how the content was formed - its conciseness, relevance, accuracy - was the mechanism that made it all possible. This was the community of software developers who wrote the questions and answers. They acted out of a mix of enlightened self-interest and social ties. They knew what worked for them, and made it happen through open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-it-went-from-there&quot;&gt;Where it went from there&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did we do about this at the large company? To be honest, not much. At least, not quickly. If you go back today to the large company’s site, the style has evolved a bit, to be more concise. This is good. But even now, eight years later, the pages are organized around product features rather than common problems or tasks. There’s no voting system for the main documentation. There’s a Q&amp;amp;A area similar to Stack Overflow, but somehow it’s not very active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to hear from users why the Q&amp;amp;A feature hasn’t caught on - is it too similar to Stack Overflow? Too new? (It appears to have been released just this year.) I’m no longer with the company so I don’t know the background behind that. If in fact it’s just a problem of being new, it’ll be interesting to see where the Q&amp;amp;A section goes in the next couple of years - perhaps it’ll eclipse the main documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amazon-vs-stack-overflow&quot;&gt;Amazon vs Stack Overflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we can take away from Stack Overflow is that relevance is the single most important thing about what we write. It’s much more important than style and polish. A technical user is going to ask “Does this page solve my problem?”, nothing more. Forget your assumptions from print publishing about the need for writing to be spotless. Forget about impressing people with how educated you are. Just convey an idea in the quickest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lean--minimalist&quot;&gt;Lean = minimalist&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that this idea of minimalist writing resonates very well at Amazon. The Amazon culture is conditioned by lean ideas inherited from Toyota, where anything that doesn’t ultimately provide value to the customer should be considered waste and rooted out. This includes writing that doesn’t solve a specific problem. Lengthy documents and pages are frowned upon. There’s often no documentation at all, especially if there are other ways of sharing information, like through an automated tool or a web service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minimalism can feel a bit scary sometimes, even chaotic - so little is written down. But it’s by design. A technical writer at Amazon often spends more time cutting content (written by engineers) than adding new. And this is a good thing, as the web community has shown with its embrace of Stack Overflow. By erring on the side of not documenting things, Amazon can document only that which is essential - and ensure relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;open--community-effort&quot;&gt;Open = community effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major internal platforms at Amazon are as open as Stack Overflow to collaboration. Everyone shares an enormous wiki with millions of pages, and nearly all of those pages can be commented and edited by anyone in the company who sees a need for a correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon also has an internal question and answer platform that  works much like Stack Overflow. It has the openness of the wiki, and includes the same sort of gamification and focus on problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Amazon has fully embraced the Stack Overflow model - relevance made possible by being open to the broadest possible community of contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="relevance" /><summary type="html">Once upon a time, a large software company in Redmond wanted to publish the best pages on the web for developers.
